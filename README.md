# Password Generator

A password creator that generates randomly based on the user's selections. Can generate a password that's 8 to 128 characters long.

# Motivation

It was a project homework for a bootcamp I was attending. We started learning Javascript, mainly working with arrays, for loops, and if statments.

# Features

- With a simple interface, the Password Generator will create complex passwords for the user. 

- In the beginnning, it asks the user how many characters they want in their password then it verifies the number they've entered.

- It then asks if they want lowercase and/or uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. If the user doesn't select anything offered, the app will let the user know that at least one type of character is required to generate a random password.

- Once the criteria is met, the app will generate a random password based on the user's selections.

# How to Use

- To begin, click the red "Generate Password" button.

You will then be asked a series of questions that must be answered:
- "How many characters would you like in your password?" (Must be a number between 8-128)
- "Do you want lowercase letters?" (OK for Yes, CANCEL for No)
- "Do you want uppercase letters?" (OK for Yes, CANCEL for No)
- "Do you want numbers?" (OK for Yes, CANCEL for No)
- "Do you want special characters?" (OK for Yes, CANCEL for No)

- Once you answer the final question, your password will be generated automatically!

- To create a new password, simply click the red "Generate Password" button again.
